## TwoColumn Layout

Create side-by-side content layouts for comparisons or complementary information.

<TwoColumn layout="equal">
  ### Before

  ```javascript
  // Old approach
  const data = getData();
  processData(data);
  displayData(data);
  ```

  ### After

  ```javascript
  // New approach with async/await
  const data = await getData();
  await processData(data);
  await displayData(data);
  ```
</TwoColumn>

<TwoColumn layout="sidebar-right">
  Main content goes here. This is the primary column with all your detailed information. The sidebar will appear on the right side on larger screens.

  You can write multiple paragraphs, add **formatting**, and include all standard markdown elements.

  ***

  ### Sidebar

  Quick tips, related links, or supplementary information goes here.

  * Key point 1
  * Key point 2
  * Key point 3
</TwoColumn>

## Mixing Components

You can combine these components for powerful layouts:

<Callout type="info">
  <Quote author="Design Principle">
    Start with the content, then layer on the design. Never the other way
    around.
  </Quote>
</Callout>

***

That's it! Use these components to create engaging, beautiful blog posts that match your site's design system.
